# Simple Tutorials folder

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this link.

These are just simple codes from different totorials online and from course mentors as part of my dev journey.
Feel free to examine the codes, make corrections where necessary, or even copy any sections of the code if you think they'll be helpful to you.

**I am currently on a journey to be a full stack developer, with more interest on back-end developmend and software engineering in general.**

## The challenge

The challenge is to pick up start up beginner projects and build them in multiple languages. Javascript, Javascript-OOP, Python, and C.

While I am more comfortable with Javascript, I only just started learing Python and C to add to my portfolio.

No deployment on any of the codes in this sections. Everything is writing purely for backend. Code can be downloaded and tested on any machine.
